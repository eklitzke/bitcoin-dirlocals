This is the
[.dir-locals.el](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Directory-Variables.html)
file I use when working on Bitcoin from Emacs. This should approximately set up
Emacs to do the right thing when working on Bitcoin code. This might get a
little out of sync with the one I actually use, I'll try to update this repo
from time to time.
