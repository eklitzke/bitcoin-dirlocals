This is the
[.dir-locals.el](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Directory-Variables.html)
file I use when working on Bitcoin from Emacs. This should approximately set up
Emacs to do the right thing when working on Bitcoin code. A few of the variables
in here are specific to [Spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs)
layers.

This might get a little out of sync with the one I actually use, I'll do my best
to keep it up to date.
